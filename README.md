# bar_code_detection_basic
Used simple and robust computer vision techniques to detect Barcode in a video/image.

Displays image at different stages of the algorithm application which will help in debugging.

Used simple assumption:
  a)Bar code has more dominant horizontal edges as compared to vertical edge.
